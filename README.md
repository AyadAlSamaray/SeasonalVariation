# Seasonal Variation in Cosmic Ray Detection Rates

This repository contains the code and resources used for analyzing **Seasonal Variation in Cosmic Ray Detection Rates**. This research was conducted during the REU experience, in collaboration with **Reman Adhikari** and under the mentorship of **Professor Dennis Soldin**.

## Research Summary

Our study focuses on detecting seasonal variations in cosmic ray rates using data collected from various cosmic ray detectors. Understanding these variations helps in refining models of cosmic ray interactions with Earth's atmosphere and contributes to broader astrophysical research.

## Running the Code

To replicate our analysis:

1. Download the cosmic ray data from the HiSPARC website:  
   **[Data Source](https://data.hisparc.nl/media/jsparc/data_retrieval.html)**

2. Update the file paths in each script to point to the downloaded data. This will allow you to generate the graphs and results as demonstrated in our research.
